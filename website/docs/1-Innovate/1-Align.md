# Introduction and Goals
In today's fast-paced world, automation has become the key to efficiency and agility. IBM MQ is a powerful messaging middleware that enables reliable communication between applications, and GitOps is a methodology that provides a streamlined approach to software delivery. Together, they offer an automated solution that can help you achieve faster and more efficient deployment of IBM MQ environments.

With GitOps, you can automate the deployment and management of IBM MQ, including rolling upgrades, queue creation, and test data setup. By using version control to manage configuration changes, you can ensure that your IBM MQ environment is always in sync with your code changes.

Rolling upgrades are a breeze with GitOps, as you can easily roll out new versions of IBM MQ across your entire infrastructure without disrupting existing connections. You can also automate the creation and configuration of queues, reducing the likelihood of human error and ensuring consistent performance.

Test data is an essential part of any software development cycle, and with GitOps, you can automate the setup and deployment of test data for your IBM MQ environment. This ensures that your testing is always consistent and that you can easily revert to previous versions if necessary.

## Background and Business Problem
Automating IBM MQ through GitOps offers a powerful solution for managing your messaging middleware. It enables faster and more efficient deployment, reduces the risk of human error, and provides a streamlined approach to software delivery that can help you stay ahead of the competition.
